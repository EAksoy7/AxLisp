Elisp (Emin's Lisp) is a small LISP implementation in C, created by following buildyourownlisp.com. I'm working on this as a study project to learn more about LISP and C. Perhaps someday I'll make it into a more full fledged LISP version.

Currently in development, essentially a glorified calculator at this point

To compile with GCC:
gcc -std=c99 -Wall elisp.c mpc.c -ledit -lm -o elisp

Some fiddling may be necessary with the editline import. Some operating systems may need an additional #include with editline/history.h or histedit.h

Issues/TODO:
	All versions:
		The way the interpreter deals with a minus operation with one operand is very messy and a more elegant solution should be sought
		Add min and max operators
		Add tree information functions from book
		The current way the interpreter handles floats is by casting all given values to floats and then recasting them to int if necessary. This system should be replaced with a tagged value type system later on down the line.
	Windows:
		Arrow key navigation unimplemented
		Command history unimplemented
		Placeholder readline() function currently in use
	Mac:
		N/A
	Linux:
		N/A
