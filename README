A small LISP implementation in C, created by following buildyourownlisp.com. I'm working on this as a study project to learn more about LISP and C. Perhaps someday I'll make it into a more full fledged LISP version.

Currently in development, no features to speak of. 

To compile, please include the -ledit flag.
Some fiddling may be necessary with the editline import. Some operating systems may need an additional #include with editline/history.h or histedit.h

Issues:
	All versions:
		N/A
	Windows:
		Arrow key navigation unimplemented
		Command history unimplemented
		Placeholder readline() function currently in use
	Mac:
		N/A
	Linux:
		N/A
