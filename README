A small LISP implementation in C, created by following buildyourownlisp.com. I'm working on this as a study project to learn more about LISP and C. Perhaps someday I'll make it into a more full fledged LISP version.

Currently in development, essentially a glorified calculator at this point

To compile with GCC:
gcc -std=c99 -Wall elisp.c mpc.c -ledit -lm -o elisp

Some fiddling may be necessary with the editline import. Some operating systems may need an additional #include with editline/history.h or histedit.h

Issues/TODO:
	All versions:
		Add float support; change eval() to have conditional to check for float or int and use atoi or atof therein
		The way the interpreter deals with a minus operation with one operand is very messy and a more elegant solution should be sought
		Add min and max operators
		Add tree information functions from book
	Windows:
		Arrow key navigation unimplemented
		Command history unimplemented
		Placeholder readline() function currently in use
	Mac:
		N/A
	Linux:
		N/A
